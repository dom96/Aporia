# of interesting things in it.

# your developer access to an SVN repo. It doesn't work, of course,
# because gnome has migrated to git.

#

elif _jhb == "FW":
    # The framework build...
    # checkoutroot = os.path.expanduser("~/Source/gtk-fw")
    # prefix = "/opt/gtk-fw"

# Do note, though, that jhbuildrc-gtk-osx also uses $JHB to find
# another customization file that is loaded after this one. You can,
# of course, define your own environment variables for passing in
# parameters.

# In addition, you can override _exec_prefix (used to set $M4 and
# $LIBTOOLIZE); by default it's set to prefix. You might want to reset
# it if you want to bootstrap to one directory and build in another
# (or more likely, several others). Mind that this is fiddly and
# requires tweaking a bunch of things to get autoconf to consistently
# find the right m4 files. Not really recommended. Similarly, you can
# override tarballdir so that you need download tarballs only once for
# multiple builds. This works just as you'd expect and can save quite
# a bit of time if you're maintaining several trees.

# .jhbuildrc has a master function, setup_sdk(target, sdk_version,
# [architectures]) which sets up the build environment. You *must*
# call it or one of the functions (setup_sdk_10_4(),
# setup_ppc_build(), or setup_universal_build()) in jhbuildrc-custom.
#
# Target can be "10.4", "10.5", or "10.6". It sets
# MACOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET and the -macosx-version-min CFLAG.
#
# Setup_sdk can be any version from "10.4u" or later, or "native". "Native" will
# not set -sysroot in CFLAGS, so headers and dylibs will come from
# /usr instead of /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX_sdk.10.foo. If you are
# building for distribution, you probably want to use the lowest SDK
# which will successfully build you modules. The exception is if you
# are building under Tiger, because
# a) You're already using the lowest compatible SDK
# b) Cups 1.2.12, which you must install to build Gtk+, installs new
# headers and libraries into /usr but not into
# /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX_sdk_10.4u.
#
# Architectures is a list (pass the arguments in brackets) which can
# include the values "ppc", "i386", "x86_64", and _default_arch. That
# last one is a variable and doesn't get quotes. Don't pass multiple
# arguments directly to setup_sdk, though, because that would build
# universal and several packages need special handling to build
# universal. Use setup_universal_build instead. Do note, though, that
# while setup_universal_build will build successfully, the result will
# usually crash because of endianness problems with icon caches. Help
# is welcome to fix this. The special argument _default_arch is a
# variable set by jhbuildrc depending on what platform you're on. It
# doesn't set the -arch CFLAG at all, so your architecture will be
# whatever you get that way. Note that on Snow Leopard, if you are
# building on a 64-bit processor (Xeon, Core2duo, or one of the Core
# iFoo procesors), the architecure is x86_64 by default; otherwise
# it's i386, which is 32-bit. Be sure to read
# http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gtk-osx/wiki/SnowLeopard.
