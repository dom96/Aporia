# Aporia
Aporia is an IDE for the Nim programming language. Aporia uses GTK as the 
default toolkit, and the gtksourceview for the text editor component.

## Compiling
To compile Aporia you need the latest version of the nim compiler, preferably
the unstable release from github. Aporia sometimes relies on bug fixes 
which have not yet made it to a stable release.

You can build it by running ``nim c aporia`` or by using nimble ``nimble build``.

You can also quickly install it using nimble without the need to clone this repo
yourself, just execute ``nimble install aporia@#head``.

### Compiling from C sources
If you do not want to get the nim compiler you can still compile Aporia from
the generated C sources, it's as simple as executing the ``build.sh`` script
(or ``build.bat`` on Windows). You can then also use ``install.sh`` to install
Aporia.

## Dependencies
* GTK
* GtkSourceView
* PCRE
* `gtk2` nimble package (if you're not installing through nimble)

Installation instructions:

### Windows
#### GTK+
If you already have GTK+ on your system, you don't need to do anything. Just
make sure GTK+ is in your PATH.

If you don't have GTK+ installed then you need to install it. You can get the 
latest version from [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk-win/ "GTK+ Runtime").
Make sure that the installer adds GTK+ to the PATH.
#### GtkSourceView
The GtkSourceView doesn't have an installer, however binaries are available 
from [here](http://ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtksourceview/ "GtkSourceView")
 ([win64](http://ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/gnome/binaries/win64/gtksourceview/ "GtkSourceView")). Just pick
the latest version and download the archive then copy the files/folders
in the archive into the 'bin' directory in gtk's directory
(Most likely: ``C:\Program Files\GTK2-Runtime\bin``).
#### libxml2-2
GtkSourceView depends on libxml2-2. This should be downloaded from 
[here](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/dependencies/ "dependencies")
 ([win64](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win64/dependencies/ "dependencies")).
And the contents of it should be copied the same 'bin' directory as GtkSourceView above.
The zip you are looking for is usually called ``libxml2_2.X.X-1_win32.zip``
#### pcre
The dll for this can be found in nim's repo, in the ``"dist"`` directory. Just
copy it into aporia's directory or somewhere into your PATH.
#### Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (*optional*)
If you are experiencing a ``MSVC100.dll cannot be found`` then you may need to install
the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package, this can be downloaded from [here](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=5555)
 ([win64](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=14632))

### Linux
Use your package manager to install the dependencies.
### Mac OS X
Since Aporia uses gtk, and gtk is not easy to compile natively under MacOSX
(yet), your best bet is to install [Macports](http://www.macports.org/) and
then install the gtk libraries through the following commands:

    port install gtksourceview2 libiconv

That will likely install most, if not all dependencies required by Aporia. Now,
you may also need to run the following command to let the OS find the path to
the macports libraries when invoking aporia:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib/

If running now ``aporia`` tells you about a missing dynamic library,
dependencies might have changed and you could need to ``port install`` another
package (tell us this is broken [creating an
issue](https://github.com/nim-lang/Aporia/issues) and we will update the
documentation).
